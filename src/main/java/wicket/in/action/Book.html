	<h2>About Wicket in Action</h2>
	<p>
	
		There are dozens of Java frameworks out there, but most of
	    them require you to learn special coding techniques and new,
	    often rigid, patterns of development. Wicket is different. As
	    a component-based web application framework, Wicket lets you
	    build maintainable enterprise-grade web applications using the
	    power of plain old Java objects (POJOs), HTML, Ajax, Spring,
	    Hibernate, and Maven. Wicket automatically manages state at
	    the component level, which means no more awkward HTTPSession
	    objects. Its elegant programming model enables you to write
	    rich web applications quickly.

		<a href="http://manning.com/dashorst">Wicket in Action</a>
	    is an authoritative, comprehensive guide for Java
	    developers building Wicket-based web applications. This
	    book starts with an introduction to Wicket's structure and
	    components, and moves quickly into examples of Wicket at
	    work. Written by two of the project's earliest and most
	    authoritative experts, this book shows you both the
	    &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; and the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of Wicket.
	    As you move through the book, you'll learn to use and
	    customize Wicket components, how to interact with other
	    technologies like Spring and Hibernate, and how to build
	    rich, Ajax-driven features into your applications.
